## Brief

To create an individual project encorperating dev ops principles, using python to, encapsulating  git, basic linux, python web developement, continuous integration, the cloud and databases. 

## Solution

My project is to create an application that sorts music based on genre into seperate folders. This requires the program to read the id3 tags and find the artist information to compare with artists stored in a database under certain genres. 
The database consists of 3 tables: Artists, Genre and Tracks
